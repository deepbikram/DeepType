## üêõ Common Issues & Quick Fixes

// Fix: Check .env.local exists and has correct values
cat .env.local

// Restart app:
# Ctrl+C in terminal, then:
npm start
```

### Issue: Second window doesn't join same room
```javascript
// Check Supabase Dashboard:
// 1. Go to Table Editor
// 2. Check "rooms" table - should have 1 room
// 3. Check "players" table - should have 2 players with same room_id

// If not, check Supabase logs for errors
```

### Issue: Progress bars don't update
```javascript
// Check browser console for subscription errors
// Common error: "subscription not authorized"

// Fix: Re-run SQL script in Supabase to set up RLS policies
```

### Issue: Game doesn't start with 2 players
```javascript
// Check room state in Supabase:
// Table Editor ‚Üí rooms ‚Üí game_state column

// Should transition: waiting ‚Üí starting ‚Üí running
